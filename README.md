-  Hi, I’m Amruth Ayaan
-  Student at IIITK
-  I’m interested in computer architecture, hardware accelerators and bare metal programming
-  Past : Dived deep into writing custom drivers for peripherals, surface level ML/DL
-  Future : Dive deeper into CUDA and GPU architecture design, also explore Stochastic Calculus and Measure Theory
-  Fun fact : I do math on MathematicsStackExchange in free time to stay sane, currently playing around with logarithmic integrals + I randomly pop on Medium and write whatever I feel is cool
-  I hope you find my repositories useful :)
